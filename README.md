# The State of Oncology and Future Directions

## Major Advances in Oncology
The treatment landscape has shifted from one-size-fits-all chemotherapy to therapies tailored to tumor genetics. Small-molecule targeted drugs and biologics now attack specific cancer-driving mutations or pathways, sparing normal cells. This trend began with successes like imatinib for CML in 2001 and has expanded across cancers. Notably, dozens of targeted kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies are approved for molecular subsets of lung, breast, colorectal cancers and more. Recent breakthroughs include targeting previously “undruggable” oncogenes – for example, new inhibitors of the mutant KRAS gene (once deemed impossible to block) showed dramatic results in lung cancer. The FDA approved the first KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibitors (sotorasib, adagrasib) in 2021–2022, marking an astounding breakthrough that extended survival in patients who had exhausted other options. Other emerging targeted approaches include antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs), which deliver potent chemotoxins directly to cancer cells via targeted antibodies. ADCs such as trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) have recently shown efficacy even in tumors with low antigen levels (e.g. HER2-low breast cancer), expanding treatment to new patient subsets. Overall, precision oncology has proven that matching therapies to tumor biomarkers can improve outcomes and is now standard in many cancers (e.g. EGFR or ALK inhibitors in lung cancer, BRAF inhibitors in melanoma). Ongoing advances aim to address resistance mechanisms and widen the scope of actionable targets, including synthetic lethal targets beyond classic oncogenes

## Immunotherapy Revolution
 Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer has emerged as a transformative strategy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) – antibodies that unblock T-cell activity by targeting PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 – have produced unprecedented durable responses in several cancers. Since their first approvals in 2011–2014, ICIs have become routine for melanoma, lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, many others, and can lead to long-term remission in a subset of patients. For example, advanced melanoma, once uniformly fatal, now sees significantly improved survival in some patients with combined immunotherapy. Beyond checkpoints, adoptive cell therapies like CAR T-cells have shown curative potential in refractory blood cancers. Multiple CAR T products (e.g. for leukemia and lymphoma) are FDA-approved, achieving high remission rates in these otherwise untreatable cases. Efforts are underway to extend cell therapies to solid tumors and to develop “off-the-shelf” allogeneic cell products to improve scalability. Another frontier is cancer vaccines. Long pursued with limited success, therapeutic cancer vaccines are now showing promise thanks to mRNA technology and neoantigen targeting. In a recent landmark study, an individualized mRNA neoantigen vaccine (developed by Uğur Şahin’s team) induced robust T-cell responses in pancreatic cancer patients and significantly prolonged their disease-free survival when added to standard therapy. This represents one of the first demonstrations that a vaccine can delay cancer recurrence in a highly lethal cancer. Similar personalized vaccines (often combined with ICIs) have shown encouraging early results in melanoma and other cancers as well. Other immunotherapy approaches contributing to the arsenal include bispecific T-cell engagers, oncolytic viruses, and novel immune modulators (e.g. agonists of co-stimulatory receptors, cytokines, etc. Immunotherapy, in summary, has become a new pillar of oncology, yielding durable remissions where conventional therapy failed. However, challenges remain: many patients do not respond or eventually develop resistance, especially in “cold” solid tumors, and immune-related toxicities need careful management

## Advances in Early Detection and Diagnostics

Finding cancer at an earlier, more curable stage has immense impact on survival. Traditional screening (mammography, colonoscopy, etc.) has reduced mortality in certain cancers. Now, emerging technologies promise to detect cancers even earlier and for tumor types with no current screening. Liquid biopsies – tests that detect tumor-derived material (DNA, cells, vesicles) in blood – have rapidly advanced as minimally invasive diagnostics. Publications on liquid biopsy have doubled since 2020, reflecting its pivotal role in precision medicine. The most common approach examines circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood, which can reveal tumor-specific mutations or methylation patterns. In 2024 this field peaked in activity, with ctDNA used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment and to monitor for relapse earlier than imaging. Serial ctDNA monitoring has shown ability to predict cancer recurrence and guide therapy adjustments before clinical progression. Liquid biopsy is also being tested for multi-cancer early detection (MCED) – screening for dozens of cancer types with a single blood draw. Such MCED assays integrate genomic, epigenomic, and even immune or metabolic markers (often coupled with AI analysis) to catch cancers at their earliest, most treatable stage. This pan-cancer screening approach could revolutionize prevention by shifting care from reactive treatment to proactive interception of cancer in asymptomatic individuals. The first MCED blood tests (e.g. Galleri) are already in pilot use, though clinical validation and adoption are ongoing. In diagnostics, pathology and radiology have seen a digital transformation. High-resolution scanners and computational tools allow pathologists and radiologists to analyze images with greater precision. For instance, FDA authorized the first AI-powered pathology software in 2021 for prostate cancer detection on digitized biopsy slides. In one study, pathologists assisted by an AI algorithm doubled their sensitivity for tiny lymph node metastases in breast cancer and cut their slide review time by ~50%. AI can also quantitatively score biomarkers (like % of cells expressing a protein) more objectively than human eyeballing, leading to more consistent treatment decisions. Similarly in radiology, AI algorithms are being used to detect lung nodules, breast tumors, and other lesions on scans, in some cases catching cancers that experts missed or improving efficiency. These digital diagnostics not only improve accuracy but also alleviate workforce burdens by handling labor-intensive tasks. Taken together, better early detection through liquid biopsies and AI-enhanced diagnostics holds promise to significantly improve survival by identifying cancers earlier and guiding therapy more effectively.
