# EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)

Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It belongs to the ErbB family of receptors (ErbB1–4) and is activated by binding to specific ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α). Upon ligand binding, EGFR undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues, initiating a cascade of downstream signaling pathways including the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK, PI3K–AKT, and JAK–STAT axes. These pathways collectively promote mitogenesis, inhibit apoptosis, and contribute to tissue repair and homeostasis under normal physiological conditions.

In oncology, however, EGFR is one of the most well-characterized oncogenic drivers, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Aberrant EGFR activity in cancer can arise through multiple mechanisms: gene amplification, overexpression, or activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain—most notably the exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutation in exon 21. These mutations lead to ligand-independent activation of the receptor, rendering cells constitutively proliferative and resistant to apoptosis.

The clinical significance of EGFR was firmly established with the development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a class of targeted therapies designed to inhibit its oncogenic activity. First-generation TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib showed efficacy in NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations, marking a paradigm shift in lung cancer treatment by ushering in an era of precision oncology. Subsequent generations of TKIs have addressed resistance mechanisms: second-generation agents like afatinib covalently inhibit EGFR and other ErbB family members, while third-generation agents like osimertinib were specifically developed to overcome the T790M “gatekeeper” mutation, a common cause of acquired resistance to earlier TKIs.

Despite these advances, resistance to EGFR inhibition remains a formidable challenge. Tumors often evolve via secondary mutations (e.g., C797S), MET amplification, or histologic transformation (e.g., to small cell phenotype). These resistance mechanisms have prompted combination strategies (e.g., EGFR + MET inhibition) and the development of fourth-generation allosteric inhibitors currently in clinical trials. In colorectal cancer, EGFR monoclonal antibodies like cetuximab and panitumumab are used, but only in patients without downstream RAS mutations, highlighting the importance of molecular context in EGFR-targeted therapy.

Moreover, EGFR-targeted approaches are expanding beyond kinase inhibition. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) such as patritumab deruxtecan, which target HER3 but leverage EGFR pathway dependency, are showing promise in resistant tumors. Novel therapeutic strategies also include bispecific antibodies and immunotherapy combinations, though EGFR-mutant tumors often display a “cold” immune microenvironment and are less responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

In summary, EGFR is a cornerstone of molecular oncology, emblematic of the success and complexity of targeted cancer therapy. Its biology is deeply entwined with cancer cell survival, and while its inhibition has transformed the treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC and other cancers, continued research is needed to overcome resistance, extend benefit to broader populations, and integrate EGFR targeting with next-generation immuno-oncology and synthetic lethality strategies.
